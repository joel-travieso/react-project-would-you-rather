# Would You Rather Project

This is the code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course. It is based in the [starter code repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter) provided by Udacity, which contains a comprehensive description of the data and API availables.

The project resembles the popular Would you rather...? game. Multiple questions are available, as well as users that can answer them. You must login before having any access to the app, and you can logout as well. In the initial page (Dashboard), all the questions are divided by whether they're answered or not. By accessing a question, a user can either answer it or see the answer provided for it in the past, as well as stats on the number of votes users have given for each option. Users can also create their own questions, and the Leaderboard page highlights the most active users attending to how much they have answered and asked.
